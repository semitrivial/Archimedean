\section{Introduction}

Whenever we measure anything using a particular number system, the
corresponding measurements will be constrained by the structure of that
number system. If the number system has a different structure than
the things we are measuring with it, then our
measurements will suffer accordingly, just as if we were trying to
force square pegs into round holes.

For example, the natural numbers make lousy candidates for measuring
distances in a physics laboratory. Distances in the lab have
properties such as, for example, the fact that for any two distinct
distances, there is an intermediate distance strictly between them.
The natural numbers lack this property. Imagine the poor physicist,
brought up in a world of only natural numbers, scratching his or her
head upon encountering a rod with length strictly between two rods
of length $1$ and $2$.

It's tempting to think of the real numbers $\mathbb R$---i.e., the unique
complete ordered field---as a generic number system with whatever
structure suits our needs. But it's important to remember that the
real numbers do have a very specific structure. That structure is
flexible enough to accomodate many needs, but we shouldn't just
take that for granted. One particular property of the real numbers
is the following.

\begin{lemma}
\label{specializedarchimedeanlemma}
(The Archimedean Property)
Let $r>0$ be any positive real number.
For every real number $y$, there is some natural number $n$
such that $nr>y$.
\end{lemma}

Rather than directly prove Lemma \ref{specializedarchimedeanlemma},
we will prove a generalized result more adaptable
to other structures.

\begin{lemma}
\label{generalizedarchimedeanlemma}
(The Generalized Archimedean Property)
Let $r>0$ be any positive real number.
For any $p,q\in\mathbb R$, say that $p$ is \emph{significantly larger}
than $q$ if $p\geq q+r$.
If $x_0,x_1,x_2,\ldots$ is any infinite sequence of real numbers,
where each $x_{i+1}$ is significantly larger than $x_i$, then for every real number $y$,
there exists some $i$ such that $x_i$ is significantly larger than $y$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If not, then there is some $y$ such that $y+r > x_i$ for all $i$.
Thus, $X=\{x_0,x_1,x_2,\ldots\}$ has an upper bound. By the completeness
of $\mathbb R$, $X$ must have a least upper bound $z\in\mathbb R$.
Since $z$ is the least upper bound for $X$, $z-r$ is not an upper bound
for $X$, so there is some $i$ such that $x_i>z-r$.
By assumption, $x_{i+1}>x_i+r$, so $x_{i+1}>z$, contradicting the choice
of $z$.
\end{proof}

Lemma \ref{specializedarchimedeanlemma} follows from
Lemma \ref{generalizedarchimedeanlemma} by letting $x_i=ir$.

The above property is automatically inherited by subsystems
of the reals, such as the rational numbers $\mathbb Q$, the natural
numbers $\mathbb N$, the integers $\mathbb Z$, or the algebraic numbers.
All inherit the Generalized Archimedean Property in obvious ways.

\begin{example}
\label{fuzzywidgets}
(Fuzzy widgets)
Suppose we have some fuzzy widgets, and we observe that certain
widgets are fuzzier than others. Naturally, we are inclined to
quantify the fuzziness of the widgets, assigning them numerical
fuzziness measures from some number system. Nine times out of ten,
we choose to use the real numbers, or a subsystem thereof,
often without a second thought. But suppose
among these widgets, there happen to be widgets $w_1,w_2,\ldots$
such that each $w_{i+1}$ is significantly fuzzier than $w_i$,
and another widget $w_\infty$ which is significantly fuzzier than all the $w_i$'s.
Suddenly, our decision to use real numbers puts us in a bind.
It is impossible to assign real number fuzziness measures to our
widgets in such a way that significantly fuzzier widgets get
significantly larger real number measures. That would
contradict Lemma \ref{generalizedarchimedeanlemma}.
\end{example}

% The premise of this paper is that certain structures are inherently
% non-Archimedean, and that when deciding how to measure such structures,
% we should be aware of potential consequences of choosing an
% Archimedean number system for those measurements.


\section{Background and Preliminaries}

The Archimedean property is named after Archimedes of Syracuse.
It appears as the fifth axiom in his \emph{On the Sphere
and Cylinder} \cite{archimedes}:
\begin{quote}
    Further, of unequal lines, unequal surfaces, and unequal
    solids, the greater exceeds the less by such a magnitude
    as, when added to itself, can be made to exceed any
    assigned magnitude among those which are comparable with
    [it and with] one another.
\end{quote}
The Archimedean property is also closely related to Definition 4 of Book V of Euclid's
\emph{Elements} \cite{euclid}:
\begin{quote}
    (Those) magnitudes are said to have a ratio
    with respect to one another which, being
    multiplied, are capable of exceeding one
    another.
\end{quote}

The real numbers possess the Archimedean property, but other structures
may or may not. To make this more precise,
we introduce the following formalism, adapting from Lemma \ref{generalizedarchimedeanlemma}.

\begin{definition}
    A \emph{significantly-ordered structure} is a set $X$ with
    an ordering $\ll$.
    For $x_1,x_2\in X$, we say $x_2$ is \emph{significantly greater}
    than $x_1$ if $x_1\ll x_2$.
    A significantly-ordered structure is \emph{Archimedean} if it
    has the following property: for every $X$-sequence
    $x_0\ll x_1\ll x_2 \ll \cdots$,
    for every $x_\infty\in X$, there is some $i$ such that $x_\infty\ll x_i$.
\end{definition}

A prototypical example of an Archimedean significantly-ordered structure is the real
numbers with the significantly-less-than ordering defined such that
$x_1\ll x_2$ if $x_2\geq x_1+1$.
Before giving examples of non-Archimedean significantly-ordered structures,
we will first develop some more formalism.

\begin{definition}
    Suppose $(X,\ll_X)$ and $(Y,\ll_Y)$
    are significantly-ordered structures.
    A function $f:X\to Y$ is \emph{order-preserving} if it satisfies the following
    requirement:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item
            For all $x_1,x_2\in X$, $x_1\ll_X x_2$ if and only if
            $f(x_1)\ll_Yf(x_2)$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

The following proposition formalizes the dilemma we illustrated in
Example \ref{fuzzywidgets} (think of $X$ as a set of things we
want to measure, and think of $Y$ as a number system we want to use to
perform said measurement).

\begin{proposition}
\label{maindilemma}
(Inadequacy of Archimedean number systems for non-Archimedean structures)
    Suppose $(X,\ll_X)$ and $(Y,\ll_Y)$
    are significantly-ordered structures.
    If $Y$ is Archimedean and $X$ is non-Archimedean, then there cannot exist
    an order-preserving function $f:X\to Y$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    Assume, for sake of a contradiction, that there is some order-preserving
    $f:X\to Y$.
    Since $X$ is non-Archimedean, there is some $X$-sequence
    $x_0\ll_X x_1\ll_X \cdots$ and some
    $x_\infty\in X$ such that there is no $i$ such that $x_\infty\ll_X x_i$.
    Since $f$ is order-preserving,
    $f(x_0)\ll_Y f(x_1) \ll_Y \cdots$.
    Since $Y$ is Archimedean, there must be some $i$ such that
    $f(x_\infty)\ll_Y f(x_i)$.
    Since $f$ is order-preserving, $x_\infty\ll_X x_i$, a contradiction.
\end{proof}

Proposition \ref{maindilemma} tells us that we cannot faithfully measure
non-Archimedean structures using an Archimedean number system.
Any attempt to do so will necessarily be misleading, because ordering
relationships among the non-Archimedean structures will fail to be reflected
by the numerical measurements given to them.
We will inevitably end up like the puzzled physicist
brought up in a world of only natural numbers, confronted by a rod of
length $1.5$.

\begin{example}
\label{nonexamples}
(Examples of non-Archimedean structures)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item
        (Sets)
        Say that set $U$ is significantly larger than set $V$ if there is an injective
        function from $V$ into $U$ but there is no bijective function from $V$
        onto $U$. It is easy to show there are sets $U_0,U_1,\ldots$, with each
        $U_{i+1}$ significantly larger than $U_i$, and $U_\infty=\cup_{i=0}^\infty U_i$
        is a set which is significantly larger than all of them. Thus, sets are
        non-Archimedean. In the field of \emph{set theory}, logicians measure
        the size of sets using Georg Cantor's famous non-Archimedean number system,
        the cardinal numbers.
        \item
        (Logical theories)
        It is not difficult to come up with (for example) true
        theories $T_0,T_1,\ldots$ (in the language of arithmetic) such that
        each $T_{i+1}$ proves the consistency of $T_i$, and an additional
        true theory $T_\infty$ (in the language of arithmetic)
        which proves the consistency of $\cup_{i=0}^\infty T_i$.
        In a sense, then, each $T_{i+1}$ is significantly stronger than $T_i$
        (see G\"odel's incompleteness theorems), and $T_\infty$ is
        significantly stronger than each $T_i$. In this sense, logical theories
        are non-Archimedean. In the field
        of \emph{proof theory} \cite{pohlers2008proof},
        logicians measure the logical strength of theories not using real numbers
        but using computable ordinal numbers, a non-Archimedean number system
        (we will discuss computable ordinals below).
        \item
        (Probability)
        The measurable subsets of $\mathbb R$ are non-Archimedean
        if we define $\ll$ such that for all measurable subsets
        $X,Y$ of $\mathbb R$, $X\ll Y$ if and only if
        $X\subseteq Y$ and $|Y-X|=\infty$.
        Nevertheless, probability theorists routinely
        measure such sets using the real number system, which is Archimedean.
        The inadequacy expressed in Proposition \ref{maindilemma}
        manifests itself in well-known paradoxes such as the fact that
        an event can have probability $0$ and yet still be possible,
        or can have probabity $1$ and yet not be guaranteed,
        or that an infinite event can have probability $0$.
        See \cite{benci2013non} for an alternative non-Archimedean approach
        to probability.
        \item
        (Nonstandard cosmologies)
        Some authors \cite{andreka2012logic} \cite{rosinger2007cosmic} have
        even speculated about the cosmology of physical universes
        with non-Archimedean spacetime.
    \end{itemize}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
\label{speculativeexamples}
    (Speculative examples of potentially non-Archimedean structures)
    Certain structures might plausibly be non-Archimedean, but it is a difficult
    question to say whether they truly are or not. The reader could come up with
    such examples in great abundance; we will give three examples.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item
        (Musical beauty)
        It is plausible that music might be non-Archimedean, in the following
        sense: there might be songs $S_0,S_1,\ldots$ such that each $S_{i+1}$
        is significantly beautiful than $S_i$, and another song
        $S_\infty$ which is significantly more beautiful than all the $S_i$'s.
        \item
        (Literature)
        It is plausible that there might be stories $S_0,S_1,\ldots$ such that
        each $S_{i+1}$ is significantly more entertaining than $S_i$, and
        another story $S_{i+1}$ which is significantly more entertaining than
        all the $S_i$'s.
        \item
        (Video game difficulty)
        It is plausible that there might be video games $V_0,V_1,\ldots$ such that
        each $V_{i+1}$ is significantly more difficult than $V_i$, and another
        video game $V_\infty$ which is significantly more difficult than
        all the $V_i$'s.
    \end{itemize}
\end{example}

\section{Reinforcement learning}

In reinforcement learning (RL), an agent interacts with an environment,
taking actions from a fixed set of possible actions. With every action the
agent takes, the environment responds with a new observation and with a
reward. In traditional RL, these rewards are real numbers (many
authors further constrain them to be rational numbers).

By restricting rewards to be real (or rational) numbers, we unconsciously
constrain RL to only be applicable toward tasks of an inherently Archimedean
nature. For example, Wirth et al point out \cite{wirth2017survey} that
in tasks related to cancer treatment \cite{zhao2009reinforcement},
``the death of a patient should be avoided at any cost. However, an
infinitely negative reward breaks classic reinforcement learning algorithms
and arbitrary, finite values have to be selected.'' This problem could be
avoided if instead of real numbers, rewards were drawn from a suitable
non-Archimedean number system containing negative infinites,
for example, from the so-called
surreal numbers (which we will discuss further on). Doing so would, however,
be a departure from traditional RL.

To give an intuitive example, assume that musical beauty is non-Archimedean,
as in Example \ref{speculativeexamples}. We can imagine environments where the
RL agent is tasked with composing songs. For example, the possible actions the
agent is allowed to make might include one action for each piano key, plus
an additional ``stand and bow'' action to signal that a song is
finished.
Whenever the agent stands and bows, the agent is awarded with applause based on
the beauty of the song the agent
composed\footnote{To quote Wang and Hammer: ``Decision makings often do not happen
at the level of basic operations, but at the level of composed actions, where
there are usually infinite possibilities.'' \cite{wang2015assumptions}}. Assuming
musical beauty is
non-Archimedean, such an environment falls outside the possibility of traditional
RL. By Lemma \ref{maindilemma}, there is no way to assign real number
rewards to songs without misleading the agent. If $S_0,S_1,S_2,\ldots$ are songs
where each $S_{i+1}$ is significantly more beautiful than $S_i$, and $S_\infty$
is a song significantly more beautiful than all the $S_i$'s, then there is no way to
assign real-valued rewards to these songs such that each $S_{i+1}$ gets
significantly more reward than $S_i$ and such that $S_\infty$ gets significantly
more reward than all the $S_i$'s.

Or, to re-use the cancer example, assume there are certain bad procedures the
robotic surgeon could take, each one significantly worse than the previous,
but all still significantly better than killing the patient. There is no way
to assign real-valued rewards to these actions, and to killing the patient,
in such a way that each bad action gets punished significantly harsher than
the previous, but still significantly more forgiving than the punishment for
killing the patient.

The reader might object by challenging the above assumptions (non-Archimedeanness
of music and of medical procedures). But we only used those to make the examples
more intuitive. If the reader insists, we can resort to mathematical tasks.
For example, imagine that instead of playing piano, the agent is tasked with
typing up mathematical theories, and when the agent stands and bows, the agent
is rewarded with applause based on the proof-theoretical strength of the theory
(or hit with tomatoes if the theory is inconsistent).
In Example \ref{nonexamples} we noted that proof-theoretical strength of theories
is non-Archimedean. There exist theories $T_0,T_1,\ldots$, each significantly
proof-theoretically stronger than the previous, and another theory $T_\infty$,
significantly proof-theoretically stronger than all the $T_i$'s. We cannot
possibly assign real-valued rewards to these theories without misleading the
agent.

The reader might object to the above example because judging the proof-theoretical
strength of a theory is inherently non-computable anyway. The example could be
modified so that instead of typing up mathematical theories, the agent has to
type up mathematical subtheories in (say) the language of Peano arithmetic,
accompanied by consistency proofs in (say) ZFC. It can be shown that the
proof-theoretical strength of mathematical theories is still non-Archimedean,
even when restricted to subtheories of arithmetic whose consistency can be
proven in ZFC.

The reader might object that the above theories-with-proofs example is contrived.
But if an AGIs has human or superhuman intelligence, then even such contrived
tasks should pose no problem for that AGI. When we prove that the Halting Problem
is unsolvable, we do so by considering contrived programs that we could write if
the Halting Problem were solvable. The contrivedness of those programs does not
invalidate the proof of the unsolvability of the Halting Problem. Again, when we
prove that C++ templates are Turing complete \cite{veldhuizen}, we do so by
considering extremely
bizarre C++ templates that would never arise naturally in a software
studio. This does not invalidate the proof that C++ templates are Turing complete.
Reinforcement Learning is very useful for many practical tasks, but at least in
its traditional flavor, it is too constrained to be brought to bear on certain
non-Archimedean tasks\footnote{Perhaps explaining why
``despite almost two decades of RL research, there has been little solid
evidence of RL systems that may one day lead to [AGI]''
\cite{livingston}.}, which, however contrived they are, could certainly be
attempted by an AGI. Reinforcement learning will not lead to AGI.
