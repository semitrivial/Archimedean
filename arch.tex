\section{Introduction}

Whenever we measure anything using a particular number system, the
corresponding measurements will be constrained by the structure of that
number system. If the number system has a different structure than
the things we are measuring with it, then our
measurements will suffer accordingly, just as if we were trying to
force square pegs into round holes.

For example, the natural numbers make lousy candidates for measuring
distances in a physics laboratory. Distances in the lab have
properties such as, for example, the fact that for any two distinct
distances, there is an intermediate distance strictly between them.
The natural numbers lack this property. Imagine the poor physicist,
brought up in a world of only natural numbers, scratching his or her
head upon encountering a rod with length strictly between two rods
of length $1$ and $2$.

It's tempting to think of the real numbers $\mathbb R$---i.e., the unique
complete ordered field---as a generic number system with whatever
structure suits our needs. But it's important to remember that the
real numbers do have a very specific structure. That structure is
flexible enough to accomodate many needs, but we shouldn't just
take that for granted. One particular property of the real numbers
is the following.

\begin{lemma}
\label{specializedarchimedeanlemma}
(The Archimedean Property)
Let $r>0$ be any positive real number.
For every real number $y$, there is some natural number $n$
such that $nr>y$.
\end{lemma}

Rather than directly prove Lemma \ref{specializedarchimedeanlemma},
we will prove a generalized result more adaptable
to other structures.

\begin{lemma}
\label{generalizedarchimedeanlemma}
(The Generalized Archimedean Property)
Let $r>0$ be any positive real number.
For any $p,q\in\mathbb R$, say that $p$ is \emph{significantly larger}
than $q$ if if $p\geq q+r$.
If $x_0,x_1,x_2,\ldots$ is any infinite sequence of real numbers,
where each $x_{i+1}$ is significantly larger than $x_i$, then for every real number $y$,
there exists some $i$ such that $x_i$ is significantly larger than $y$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If not, then there is some $y$ such that $y+r > x_i$ for all $i$.
Thus, $X=\{x_0,x_1,x_2,\ldots\}$ has an upper bound. By the completeness
of $\mathbb R$, $X$ must have a least upper bound $z\in\mathbb R$.
Since $z$ is the least upper bound for $X$, $z-r$ is not an upper bound
for $X$, so there is some $i$ such that $x_i>z-r$.
By assumption, $x_{i+1}>x_i+r$, so $x_{i+1}>z$, contradicting the choice
of $z$.
\end{proof}

Lemma \ref{specializedarchimedeanlemma} follows from
Lemma \ref{generalizedarchimedeanlemma} by letting $x_i=ir$.

The above property is automatically inherited by subsystems
of the reals, such as the rational numbers $\mathbb Q$, the natural
numbers $\mathbb N$, the integers $\mathbb Z$, or the algebraic numbers.
All inherit the Generalized Archimedean Property in obvious ways.

\begin{example}
\label{fuzzywidgets}
(Fuzzy widgets)
Suppose we have some fuzzy widgets, and we observe that certain
widgets are fuzzier than others. Naturally, we are inclined to
quantify the fuzziness of the widgets, assigning them numerical
fuzziness measures from some number system. Nine times out of ten,
we choose to use the real numbers, or a subsystem thereof,
often without a second thought. But suppose
among these widgets, there happen to be widgets $w_1,w_2,\ldots$
such that each $w_{i+1}$ is significantly fuzzier than $w_i$,
and another widget $w_\infty$ which is significantly fuzzier than all the $w_i$'s.
Suddenly, our decision to use real numbers puts us in a bind.
It is impossible to assign real number fuzziness measures to our
widgets in such a way that significantly fuzzier widgets get
significantly larger real number measures. That would
contradict Lemma \ref{generalizedarchimedeanlemma}.
\end{example}

% The premise of this paper is that certain structures are inherently
% non-Archimedean, and that when deciding how to measure such structures,
% we should be aware of potential consequences of choosing an
% Archimedean number system for those measurements.


\section{Background and Preliminaries}

The Archimedean property is named after Archimedes of Syracuse.
It appears as the fifth axiom in his \emph{On the Sphere
and Cylinder} \cite{archimedes}:
\begin{quote}
    Further, of unequal lines, unequal surfaces, and unequal
    solids, the greater exceeds the less by such a magnitude
    as, when added to itself, can be made to exceed any
    assigned magnitude among those which are comparable with
    [it and with] one another.
\end{quote}
The Archimedean property is also closely related to Definition 4 of Book V of Euclid's
\emph{Elements} \cite{euclid}:
\begin{quote}
    (Those) magnitudes are said to have a ratio
    with respect to one another which, being
    multiplied, are capable of exceeding one
    another.
\end{quote}

The real numbers possess the Archimedean property, but other structures
may or may not. To make this more precise,
we introduce the following formalism, adapting from Lemma \ref{generalizedarchimedeanlemma}.

\begin{definition}
    A \emph{significantly-ordered structure} is a set $X$ with
    an ordering $\ll$.
    For $x_1,x_2\in X$, we say $x_2$ is \emph{significantly greater}
    than $x_1$ if $x_1\ll x_2$.
    A significantly-ordered structure is \emph{Archimedean} if it
    has the following property: for every $X$-sequence
    $x_0\ll x_1\ll x_2 \ll \cdots$,
    for every $x_\infty\in X$, there is some $i$ such that $x_\infty\ll x_i$.
\end{definition}

A prototypical example of an Archimedean significantly-ordered structure is the real
numbers with the significantly-less-than ordering defined such that
$x_1\ll x_2$ if $x_2\geq x_1+1$.
Before giving examples of non-Archimedean significantly-ordered structures,
we will first develop some more formalism.

\begin{definition}
    Suppose $(X,\ll_X)$ and $(Y,\ll_Y)$
    are significantly-ordered structures.
    A function $f:X\to Y$ is \emph{order-preserving} if it satisfies the following
    requirement:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item
            For all $x_1,x_2\in X$, $x_1\ll_X x_2$ if and only if
            $f(x_1)\ll_Yf(x_2)$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

The following proposition formalizes the dilemma we illustrated in
Example \ref{fuzzywidgets} (think of $X$ as a set of things we
want to measure, and think of $Y$ as a number system we want to use to
perform said measurement).

\begin{proposition}
\label{maindilemma}
(Inadequacy of Archimedean number systems for non-Archimedean structures)
    Suppose $(X,\ll_X)$ and $(Y,\ll_Y)$
    are significantly-ordered structures.
    If $Y$ is Archimedean and $X$ is non-Archimedean, then there cannot exist
    an order-preserving function $f:X\to Y$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    Assume, for sake of a contradiction, that there is some order-preserving
    $f:X\to Y$.
    Since $X$ is non-Archimedean, there is some $X$-sequence
    $x_0\ll_X x_1\ll_X \cdots$ and some
    $x_\infty\in X$ such that there is no $i$ such that $x_\infty\ll_X x_i$.
    Since $f$ is order-preserving,
    $f(x_0)\ll_Y f(x_1) \ll_Y \cdots$.
    Since $Y$ is Archimedean, there must be some $i$ such that
    $f(x_\infty)\ll_Y f(x_i)$.
    Since $f$ is order-preserving, $x_\infty\ll_X x_i$, a contradiction.
\end{proof}

Proposition \ref{maindilemma} tells us that we cannot faithfully measure
non-Archimedean structures using an Archimedean number system.
Any attempt to do so will necessarily be misleading, because ordering
relationships among the non-Archimedean structures will fail to be reflected
by the numerical measurements given to them.
We will inevitably end up like the puzzled physicist
brought up in a world of only natural numbers, confronted by a rod of
length $1.5$.

\begin{example}
(Examples of non-Archimedean structures)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item
        (Probabilities)
        The measurable subsets of $\mathbb R$ are non-Archimedean
        if we define $\ll$ such that for all measurable subsets
        $X,Y$ of $\mathbb R$, $X\ll Y$ if and only if
        $X\subseteq Y$ and $|Y-X|=\infty$.
        Nevertheless, probability theorists routinely
        measure such sets using the real number system, which is Archimedean.
        The inadequacy expressed in Proposition \ref{maindilemma}
        manifests itself in well-known paradoxes such as the fact that
        an event can have probability $0$ and yet still be possible,
        or can have probabity $1$ and yet not be guaranteed,
        or that an infinite event can have probability $0$.
        See \cite{benci2013non} for an alternative non-Archimedean approach
        to probability.
    \end{itemize}
